# 3D-Cortical-Projection

This Github repository contains the codes and steps used in creating cortical projections on various brain regions, as shown in the image above (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36738990/). Additionally, it includes a detailed guide for creating surface projections or regional heat maps using FreeSurfer.

The **FS Steps.txt** directory provides a step-by-step guide on how to create surface projections or regional heat maps using FreeSurfer. Follow the instructions carefully to reproduce the results showcased in the image.

Before using the codes in this repository, ensure you have the following packages installed:

1. **Python 3**
2. **FSL (FMRIB Software Library)**
3. **FreeSurfer**

Code and script where provide by **Rachel Wagner _rwagne2@uwo.ca_**
